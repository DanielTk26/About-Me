My ambition in life is to be the CEO of NASA. I love technology and keep my knowledge and skills in progress with advancing technological developments. I love coding and robotics. I code different things from games to website and apps and am willing to learn more. I am learning on how to code robots using python. I want to give my contribution to develop the future. Apart from coding and tech, I love singing....but most of all, I am a nature lover. Much Love, God Bless You !!! 😄👍🌹
